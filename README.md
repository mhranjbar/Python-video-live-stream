# Python-video-live-stream
Python video live stream over socket

By using these codes, you can send live video stream from webcam in the client-side to the server-side.

# How it works?
1- Run the "server.py".

2- Run the "client.py".

- Be sure that the webcam works correctly.
- If you have an external webcam or more than one webcam, change the number of "cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)" from "0" to "1" or any number of your arbitrary webcam.
